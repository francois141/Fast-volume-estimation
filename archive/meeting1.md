# Meeting

## Ideas

- Put everything into a single file (put the functions in the headers)
- intel vtune try it for intel processors
- Use of xisguri128plus.h ==> User it for the random function
- Try a faster random function that ins't perfect (Not the first priority)
- Try to use flame graph[optimization_plan.txt](optimization_plan.txt)
- Try cclang insteaf of GCC
